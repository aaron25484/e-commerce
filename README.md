## Introduction

This e-commerce project is built using modern web development tools and libraries. It provides a simple yet effective foundation for creating an online shopping platform. The project's key features include a search bar, dynamic routing, form validation, and user authentication. React and React Router are used for creating the user interface, and various dependencies are managed through [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), a package manager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js and npm (or pnpm for preferred package management)
- Visual Studio Code or any code editor of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd e-commerce
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The application should now be running, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the application.
- `src/components/` - Contains React components used to build the UI.
- `src/routes/` - Defines the application routes and components for each route.
- `src/context/` - Contains context providers for managing global state.
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for handling various functionalities.
- `src/assets/` - Holds static assets such as images and data.
- `src/App.tsx` - The entry point of the application.

## Key Features

### Search Bar

The search bar enables users to search for products by entering keywords. The search functionality provides a smooth shopping experience by quickly filtering the displayed products based on user input.

### Routes

React Router is used to manage the application's routes, ensuring that each page has its URL and content. This allows users to navigate between different sections of the website without a full page reload.

### Form Validation

Form validation is implemented using the `react-hook-form` library, ensuring that user inputs are valid before submitting forms, such as during the checkout process.

### Hooks

The project makes extensive use of React hooks, including `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useState`, to manage component lifecycle, global state, and component-specific state.

### User Authentication

User authentication and private routes are an integral part of the e-commerce platform. Users can create accounts, log in, and access certain pages that require authentication.
